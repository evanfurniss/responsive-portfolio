                    <p>My name is Evan Furniss and I have worn many hats in my short career. Graduating from the University of Minnesota with my M.Ed., I was a substitute teacher elementary school for about 2 years. Also during that time, I worked as an educator at the Como Zoo teaching classes as they came to visit the zoo. It was during my time at the zoo that I was offered a position to teach music for St. Peter Claver and St. John Paul II schools. My time spent was split between the schools, teaching two unique student bodies the fundamentals of music using modern music software. However, I realized that this style of education was not working for me and I decided to pivot career paths.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It was during the beginning of the pandemic that made me really consider my next career path, when I heard about the Trilogy bootcamp hosted through the University of Minnesota. Since then, I have learned the fundamentals of Java and begun the difficult task of learning front-end and back-end program development. Although I am early on my path I am confident in my ability to learn new material, work with a unique group of classmates, and tackle many big ideas in a short amount of time.</p>
