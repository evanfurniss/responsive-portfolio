# Responsive Portfolio

## Overview
This assignment asked that we set up an initial portfolio page, built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and assistance from Bootstrap. With these tools I was able to create a very basic responsive style portfolio. It currently has 3 pages; an about me of days past, a contact page for present day inqueries, and a portfolio page of projects yet to come. 

I had a very hard time wrapping my brain around the idea of integrating bootstrap into the code. After some help from students, and especially the assistance of our TA, Kieran, I was able to create a basic webpage that I will continue to bulk up over our holiday break. The basics of HTML make sense, the addition of CSS is a little more fuzzy and only several hours ago did bootstrap start to click. 

Future content that will be available on my active page soon will include images of my previous work, a more personalized about me page, and a contact form that pulls that information for me and stores it for future use.

## Acknowledgements
I used Bootstrap version 4.5.3 while creating the portfolio framework.

I also utilized Google fonts for my h1 sections.
